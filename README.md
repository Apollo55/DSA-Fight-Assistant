# DsaIniTool
just a little java tool to manage DSA inis from player and npcs. 

Thers not realy much to say about. Just start a new Fight add some characters with hp and initiative and they will be sortet from the top to the bottom.

If you have some ideas for changes, just send me a message. Now Have fun clearing some dungens and rescue some princes.
